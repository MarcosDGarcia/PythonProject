# PythonProject
Personal learning using Python
On this time, I bring to GitHub a small personal project about a SingleChoice. Is small because I'm not an expert with Python but I'm learning.
This project have some code using timers, dictionaries, random numbers, counters and external file.

If there is a new type of code to learn and apply in the future, probably I will update it soon.
